Creating this folder for future code for the VRS Annotation Project, for adding more universal allele IDs to gnomAD variants. 
Will soon add my script for creating a test dataset for the annotation script (and potentially also said test dataset) to this subdirectory. 

The VRS (Variant Representation Specification) Project is sponsored by GA4GH (Global Alliance For Genomic Health) and a wiki for the VRS Project is available here: https://vrs.ga4gh.org/en/stable/introduction.html
